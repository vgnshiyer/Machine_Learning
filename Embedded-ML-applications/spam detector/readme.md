The Spam Detector for Emails project is a machine learning-based system designed to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). It utilizes a multinomial Naive Bayes model to analyze the content of emails and make predictions about their classification.

The project begins by collecting a dataset of emails, consisting of both spam and ham examples. These emails are preprocessed to clean the data and remove any irrelevant or potentially misleading information. The preprocessing steps may involve removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords, and applying stemming or lemmatization techniques.

Once the dataset is prepared, the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is employed for training the model. This algorithm is well-suited for text classification tasks and works on the principle of Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features. It calculates the probabilities of observing specific words in spam and ham emails, and based on these probabilities, predicts the class (spam or ham) for new, unseen emails.

The application itself provides a user-friendly interface where users can input an email into a text box. The entered email is then processed in the backend using the trained multinomial Naive Bayes model. The model analyzes the email's content, considering the occurrence and frequency of relevant words, and determines whether it is likely to be spam or ham.

To facilitate the classification process, the project uses an email.sqlite file, which contains preprocessed and organized emails in a format suitable for the application's needs. This file allows for efficient retrieval and utilization of the cleaned email data during runtime.

The Spam Detector for Emails project offers a practical solution for email filtering and spam detection. By accurately classifying incoming emails, it helps users prioritize their inbox, avoid potentially harmful or unwanted messages, and enhance overall email security.
