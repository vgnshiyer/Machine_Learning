Black Friday Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday. Here target feature is 'Purchase'. I ve perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), Data Cleaning and that data give to Model to predict. And last save the best model (consider more r2 score as best model).

For BlackFriday2.pkl Use https://github.com/rohangore1999/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Black%20Friday-Kaggle this ipynb notebook.

In this project I have created Total amount predictor for the black friday sale( https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday).The machine learning model I have used here is Random Forest regression.

The application asks the required input data from the user.The processing of the text is done in the backend and the result specifies the predicted total amount of the purchase.

app.py=>Is the main application file.

templates=> This folder consists of html files.

If you want a detailed view of the cleaning and preprocessing of the data and the application of the machine learning model(BlackFriday2.pkl), check out().
