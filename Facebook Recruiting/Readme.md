# Link prediction in social networks

In this project, we aim to develop an accurate and efficient link prediction model for a social network using machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict potential connections or links between users based on their existing network relationships and other relevant features.

The social network dataset provided is from a Facebook recruiting competition hosted on Kaggle. It includes information about users, their friendships, and various attributes associated with each user. The dataset represents a snapshot of the network at a specific point in time.

Link prediction plays a crucial role in social network analysis, as it helps uncover hidden relationships, identify potential connections, and understand the dynamics of network growth. By accurately predicting future connections, we can enhance user recommendations, improve targeted advertising strategies, and gain insights into community detection and network evolution.

To tackle this problem, we will employ state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and techniques. This may involve feature engineering, graph-based methods, and predictive modeling. We will explore different approaches and evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

By accurately predicting links between users, we can gain valuable insights into the underlying social network dynamics and contribute to the field of social network analysis.
